The included 6&rdquo; rubber treaded wheels allow for easy traversing across the field and over the cable protector.&nbsp;The center wheel of the AM14U5 is dropped &#8539;&rdquo; lower than the other wheels, this will allow for static friction when turning side to side, thus making it easier to make micro adjustments when picking up or scoring game pieces.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manual/chassis/chassis-assembly":{"id":"manual/chassis/chassis-assembly","title":"Chassis Assembly","description":"The 2023 Everybot uses the Chassis End Plates in an upside down configuration as compared to the normal Kit of Parts chassis.

Each half-pulley (AndyMark part number am-2234a-half) has one raised screw hole and one recessed screw hole on the bottom. Connect two halves together by lining the raised portion of one half with the recessed hole on the other. The ridged portion of the pulley that the belt will actually ride on should line up across the two pulleys with no gaps or misaligned teeth. The pulley is then screwed into the matching hole pattern on one side of the 6&rdquo; HiGrip wheel (am-0940b) using six 10-12 1.25&rdquo; screws (am-1592). Tighten these bolts in a star pattern like you would when changing a tire on a car to ensure the pulley is aligned evenly on the wheel.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manual/superstructure/assembly":{"id":"manual/superstructure/assembly","title":"Superstructure Assembly","description":"Tools required:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manual/superstructure/gearbox":{"id":"manual/superstructure/gearbox","title":"MAX Planetary gearbox assembly","description":"Tools required:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"manual/superstructure/machining":{"id":"manual/superstructure/machining","title":"Superstructure Machining","description":"Start by cutting all tube stock and hex shaft listed as part of the Superstructure in the cut list.
