# Precision Machining Tips

<p><br /> </p>

Some components of the Everybot will require more precise manufacturing practices. Here are some tools and tips to getting more accurate parts in a modest shop:<div style={{overflow: 'hidden', float: 'right', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px'}}><span style={{float: 'right', overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)',  width: '149.00px', height: '148.00px'}}><img src={require("/static/media/before-you-get-started/before/image_3.jpg").default} style={{ width: '196.92px', height: '148.00px', marginLeft: '-28.96px', marginTop: '0.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', maxWidth: "none"}}></img></span></div>

<ul><li><span style={{ fontWeight: "700"}}>Square:</span>&nbsp;A combination square can be used to easily mark lines to cut perpendicular to the edge of a piece of material. The metal &ldquo;handle&rdquo; slides along a ruler and can be tightened in place and provide a perpendicular edge to mark along. A &ldquo;scribe&rdquo; for scratching cut lines is also commonly screwed into the handle. A &ldquo;speed&rdquo; square or carpenter&rsquo;s square can help to make sure two components are at perfect 90 degree angles to one another.</li></ul>

<div style={{overflow: 'hidden', float: 'left', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 3.00px'}}><span style={{float: 'left', overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '20.25px -20.25px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(4.71rad) translateZ(0px)',  width: '118.10px', height: '77.61px'}}><img src={require("/static/media/before-you-get-started/before/image_4.jpg").default} style={{ width: '118.10px', height: '77.61px', marginLeft: '0.00px', marginTop: '0.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', maxWidth: "none"}}></img></span></div>

<ul><li><span style={{ fontWeight: "700"}}>Punch:</span>&nbsp;To help make accurate holes, consider marking where you need to drill with a center punch, which will leave a small indentation that you can line a drill bit up with. Automatic punches are available which do not need to be struck to make an indentation. Always drill your holes as straight as possible and on a drill press when making critical holes.</li></ul>

<ul><li><span style={{ fontWeight: "700"}}>Calipers: </span>Calipers are sort of a very accurate ruler or tape measure - but only for shorter parts. They read the distance between the two &ldquo;teeth&rdquo; - if you are trying to mark a hole 4.25 inches inwards from the edge of a part, slowly slide the display section along the ruler until it reads 4.25. Then place one of the teeth against the edge of your part, and the other will measure to the point 4.25 inches in from there. Use the teeth of the calipers to make a straight scratch in the metal, then change the distance to the 2nd dimension for the desired location and make a 2nd scratch. The center of the cross will be much more accurate than marking the location with a Sharpie, especially if you use a punch right where the marks cross before drilling.</li></ul>

<ul><li><span style={{ fontWeight: "700"}}>Drill vs Drill Press: </span>Although the Everybot can be built with just a drill, many parts will appreciate a high degree of precision, and holes will turn out straighter and more accurately located if drilled out on a drill press. When using a drill press it is still important to use a punch as the drill bit can still wander when beginning a hole. Make sure your piece is clamped firmly and that the drill bit is lined up to come down directly at the mark from your punch. Hand drills are great when making holes that do not need to be in an exact location, like the holes drilled through gussets to rivet something together. This technique of clamping a smaller component of the robot like a gusset or mounting plate to a piece of box tube and then drilling through the existing holes in the gusset or mounting plate and into the box tube behind it to make sure that holes line up is used often in constructing the Everybot.</li></ul>
